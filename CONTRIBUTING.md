First off, thank you for considering contributing to **Symphonia**! 🎶

This document lays out the guidelines to help keep the project clean, organized, and friendly for everyone.

## 📌 Branching & Workflow

- The `main` branch is **protected** and must stay clean and stable.
- Always create a **feature branch** from `main` before making changes:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
  ```

- When ready, push your branch and open a **Pull Request (PR)** into `main`.

## 🔀 Pull Requests

- All changes must go through a Pull Request.
- Please include:
  - A clear description of the changes.
  - Screenshots or examples if your changes affect the UI.
- Keep commits small and meaningful.
- We prefer **Squash Merge** for a clean history.

## ✅ Code Guidelines

- Follow consistent naming and formatting practices already present in the code.
- Comment your code if it’s not obvious.
- Test your changes locally before opening a PR.

## 🐛 Issues

- Found a bug? Open an **Issue** with steps to reproduce.
